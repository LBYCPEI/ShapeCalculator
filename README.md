# ShapeCalculator

ShapeCalculator Starter project for the problem:

Design a Java Console-based OOP application that shows a menu and calculates the area of basic shapes - square, rectangle, circle, and ellipse.

## Sample Run:

```txt
============== MAIN MENU ===============
     1. Square Computations 
     2. Rectangle Computations
     3. Circle Computations
     4. Ellipse Computations
     5. Exit

>> 1

 1. Square Computations 
Input the side of the square: 10

The area is 100.0 sq. units.
The perimeter is 40.0 units.

============== MAIN MENU ===============
     1. Square Computations 
     2. Rectangle Computations
     3. Circle Computations
     4. Ellipse Computations
     5. Exit

>> 2

 2. Rectangle Computations
Input the length: 10
Input the width: 20

The area is 200.0 sq. units.
The perimeter is 60.0 units.

============== MAIN MENU ===============
     1. Square Computations 
     2. Rectangle Computations
     3. Circle Computations
     4. Ellipse Computations
     5. Exit

>> 6
